        I'm David, a <b>Games Development student</b> from Ireland, studying at <a href="https://www.itsligo.ie/">Institute
        of Technology, Sligo</a>. I won <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Daithyi/status/984505454654054400">2 awards</a></b> in 
        <a href="http://www.lit.ie/">LIT</a>'s annual <b><a href="http://gamesfleadh.ie/">Games Fleadh 2018</a></b> student competition and 
        can't wait to enter again this year. I created a <b><a href="https://youtu.be/0QMud87XSTE?t=8m47s">custom campaign</a></b> 
        for the Half-Life mod <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/223710/Cry_of_Fear/">Cry of Fear</a> in 2012 when I was <b>15 years old</b>.

        Here you can view some of the projects I've had the opportunity of contributing to, as well as some personal fun coding stuff
        that I've been working on. Every once in a while I like to <b><a href="http://darkydude.deviantart.com/">draw</a></b> in my free time or for commission work.

        Iâ€™m always eager to learn and leverage my skills to facilitate unforgettable gameplay and narrative driven experiences. 
        Taking on new challenges is a joy for me, collaborating with a team to build something big and exciting makes it better! :)
