        I'm David, a <b>Games Development student</b> from Ireland, studying at <a href="https://www.itsligo.ie/">Institute
        of Technology, Sligo</a>. I won 2 awards in <a href="http://www.lit.ie/">LIT</a>'s annual <a href="http://gamesfleadh.ie/">Games
        Fleadh</a> student competition in 2018 and hope to enter again in 2019.

        Here you can view some of the projects I have had the opportunity of contributing to, as well as some personal fun coding stuff
        that I've been working on.

        My curiosity for how games and software work began early as a childhood hobby of mine and has overtime became what I love to do
        every day for a living.
